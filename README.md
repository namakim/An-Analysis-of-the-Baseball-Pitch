# An Analysis of the Baseball Pitch 
I conducted my own research into the data behind predicting a professional baseball players pitch. I scraped data from multiple sources like Kaggle.com and baseballsavant.com. My analysis involved utilizing the lasso shrinkage method on my generalized linear model that I was using, and subsequently made use of 2 Monte-Carlo simulations with 2 different sampling methods. This allowed me to measure the performance of my GLM model I constructed.
